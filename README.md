# Machine Learning/ Deep Learning repo:
 
***this is no longer the main repo for DL work***
 
this is a compilation in process, and has not been updated with my latest work.
as a dev, i like to create work that is easily configured by a third-party for UX/UI, this is why
only single py files exist here.
 
## work implemented in TensorFlow and Python 2.7

- 1. Deep Convolutional Network: CNN.py
 - 12 layers architecture for image classification: used CIFAR-10 dataset.
  
- 2. Recurrent Neural Network - LTSM: RNN.py
 - Using LSTM cell for generating sentences based on input from previous entries.
  
- 3. Reinforcement Learning - DRQN.py
 - Using Deep Recurrent Q-Learning Network for an agent to play a game of GridWorld using its memory.

## TF and Python 3:
 1. Keras Template for quickly deploying NNs in style ;)
